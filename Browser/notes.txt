    - px

    2. Relative: Scalable and Responsive
    - rem
    - em
    - vh vw
    - %

    - rem:  relative to html tag. (html tag have defualt font size of around 16px.)
    1rem = 1*16 px

    - em:   relative to element itself.
    Note: if it does not have any default font-value then it is relative to its parent element.
