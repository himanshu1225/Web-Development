- This is the first look of at nodejs.
- We will understand it using the analogy of android phone.
- nodejs is android phone and the node_modules are nothing but the apps in the phone.
- each app has its own features 
- in phone we click on the app it opens, here we will interact with app using js.

- JS is just for interaction, actual features are implemented by the modules and your application.
(like in programming you talk and express and actual work is done by the system)
We will look at some modules of nodejs: 
	- child_process
	- os 
	(nodejs is majorly used in making servers, so in backened where ever this is running, it will check that RAM
	is available or not, written code will run or not);

	- fs ---> file system (what ever operation you can do on file and folder, this helps us do that).
